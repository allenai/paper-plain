       "   'text': 'Following the diagnosis of SLE, patients are assessed for disease activity and organ involvement, both of which dictate the most appropriate therapy. SLE patients with a mild involvement can be easily managed with a low dose of oral steroids (to be discontinued as soon as possible), hydroxychloroquine, and symptomatic drugs. Moderate to severe manifestations usually require the addition of DMARDs and immunosuppressants, like methotrexate, mofetil mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine, or the administration of intravenous immunoglobulins. The use of biologic agents (belimumab or rituximab) is indicated in refractory forms of disease. SLE flares are treated with intravenous steroid pulses and prevented with long-term low doses of oral glucocorticoids. In addition, symptomatic or organ-specific drugs, like analgesics, antihypertensive or antiepileptic agents, are often co-prescribed. In case of a concomitant APS diagnosis, anti-thrombotic and anti-coagulant drugs, and, in severe forms, plasma exchange, may also be needed. Darker color in the bars indicates higher doses or a more common use of the referred medications.
